# What is adt_os?
It's an operating system that I am making in a youtube series that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhBirSJjNEmfBCBLjjs77oUFc-MeGwjhP)
It's intended to show people how to make their own bare metal applications for the aarch64 architecture.  

# Why are you making an operating system?
I've always been fascinated with low level topics and operating systems touch on a huge amount of topics.  
Exploration is the best way to learn something, so this is my way to learn about this while showing others the results of my learning process.

# Why are you not using any libraries
Libraries hide a lot of the complexity.  
That can be a good thing for production level software but it's usually a bad thing for learning since you can just call the functions and treat them as a black box.  
I'm writing everything myself in order to actually understand what I am doing.
